This folder will contain scripts on analyses that pertain to the question: How does bacterial community composition and alpha diversity respond to variation in plastic type, nutrients, and the presence of fish? More broadly, what are the the effects of microplastics on top-down and bottom-up control of pond ecosystems. That is, the presence and type of plastic was crossed with the presence of fish (plankton predators, top down control) and nutrients (bottom up control). Are bacterial commmunities mediators of these linkages?
